# Welcome to the API Portal of the Customer Management Microservice

As its name implies, this microservice manages customer accounts for Brilliant Mule's e-commerce website. We designed and implemented it using a top-down or contract-first approach and authored its API specification using the Open API Specification (OAS) version 3.0. Finally, we leverage Anypoint Flex Gateway to manage and secure access to the Customer Management microservice.  

In the current version, the Customer Management microservice supports the following methods:

1. Create a new customer account.
2. Retrieve all customer accounts.
3. Retrieve a customer account by its ID.
4. Update a customer account.
5. Delete a customer account.

Refer to the ***Summary*** section for further details on these methods and their expected behavior.
